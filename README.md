JavaScript Files

1. appendURLToURL.js: Appends a URL to another URL upon a button click event.
2. truncate.js: Truncates text content based on a specified limit.
3. url-scanner-util.js: Includes utility functions for URL scanning, including URL validation and animation of rows.
4. urlAPIFetch.js: Fetches data from an API and populates the data on the page.
5. urlParameterDisplayToggle.js: Handles the display of elements based on the presence of URL parameters.
6. gao_tracking_optim.js: Handles Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager integration, form submissions, and click events.
7. urlQueryParamParse.js: Parses URL query parameters, providing functionality to get, set, and remove parameters from the query string.

CSS Files

1. responsiveType.css: Contains media queries to handle typography responsiveness across different screen sizes.

Build Tasks

The gulpfile.js defines several tasks for building the project:

- minify: Minifies the JavaScript files in the scripts/ directory and outputs them to the build/ directory.
- minify-css: Minifies the CSS files in the styles/ directory and outputs them to the build/ directory.
- default: Runs the minify and minify-css tasks in parallel.

To run the build tasks, use the following command:
```
gulp
```

Best Practices

This project follows several best practices in software development:

- Modularity: Each file or module has a single responsibility, making the code easier to understand, test, and maintain.
- Immutability: The Gulp tasks do not modify the original source files; they produce new, minified versions of the files.
- Functional Programming: The Gulp tasks use a pipeline of functions to transform the input files.
